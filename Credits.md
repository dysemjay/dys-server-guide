Credits
==================================

Note that this list of credits is for those who contribute to parts of this repository, other than guide.md. My rationale for including separate credits, is that guide.md is meant to be able to exist, and be distributed independently of the other content in the repository. Much of that content is supplementary. With that said, there is a dedicated credits section included in guide.md.

  Worked as a developer for Dystopia, and was able to provide insight on its internals. Resolved question as to whether mp_scalespawntime was Dystopia specific.
